# 🌍 The Map of Many Layers

**An interactive, multi-layered fantasy GIS project for the Forgotten Realms (D&D 5e)**

**The Map of Many Layers** is a web-based mapping tool designed to bring the world of Faerûn to life — one layer at a time. Built with Leaflet.js and high-resolution fantasy cartography, this project aims to create an open-source, tile-based map of the Forgotten Realms that includes:

- 🏔️ Landmass and terrain
- 🏙️ Cities, towns, and landmarks
- 🛤️ Roads and travel routes
- 🌿 Landcover and regions
- ⚔️ Custom overlays for campaigns or quests

While originally inspired by real-world GIS tools like WMS/WFS, this project focuses on a more lightweight and accessible approach using static tiles and GeoJSON.

## ✨ Features (in progress)

- Zoomable, pannable high-resolution fantasy map
- Clickable cities and markers with info popups
- Modular layer system (planned)
- No server costs — runs entirely in the browser

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Real georeferencing with a custom CRS
- Optional WMS/WFS support using open-source servers
- Map download/export tools for GMs and players
- Campaign planning tools (e.g. custom markers, route planner)

## 🧙‍♂️ Why?

Because every world deserves a proper map — even the imaginary ones.

> **🧪 Current Status**: Milestone 1 – Static prototype with interactive map and markers  
> **🔧 Technologies**: Leaflet.js, QGIS (offline), GitHub Pages hosting
